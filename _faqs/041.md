title: May a grantee provide additional payments to landlords that enter into leases with eligible households experiencing circumstances that make it more difficult to secure rental housing?
category: pay
---

Grantees may use ERA funds to pay for an additional rental payment required by a landlord as a condition to entering into a lease with a "hard-to-house" household that would not qualify under the landlord's previously established, non-discriminatory, and lawful screening or occupancy policies. "Hard-to-house" applicants are those who, during the preceding 12 months, suffered an eviction; aged out of foster care or similar arrangements; were convicted of a criminal offense or released from incarceration; or experienced homelessness. The additional payment must be documented in the written lease agreement as additional rent and may not, in the aggregate, exceed one monthâ€™s rent (excluding the additional payment). Grantees should establish reasonable safeguards to ensure these additional rental payments do not incentivize landlords to adopt more stringent leasing policies and are otherwise compliant with any rent or security deposit restrictions imposed by state or local law.
