title: Must a grantee pay for all of a householdâ€™s rental or utility arrears?
category: pay

No. The full payment of arrears is allowed up to the limits established by the statutes, as described in <a href="#10">FAQ 10</a>. A grantee may structure a program to provide less than full coverage of arrears. Grantees are encouraged to consider whether payments of less than the full amount of arrears may result in a significant disincentive for landlord participation in the ERA program. Moreover, consistent with <a href="#32">FAQ 32</a>, grantees should consider methods for avoiding evictions for nonpayment or utility cutoffs in cases where arrearages are paid only in part.
