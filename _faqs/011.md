title: Must a grantee pay for all of a householdâ€™s rental or utility arrears?
---

No. The full payment of arrears is allowed up to the 12-month limit established by the statute. Grantees may provide assistance for an additional three months if the grantee determines that further assistance is necessary to ensure housing stability. A grantee may structure a program to provide less than full coverage of arrears.
