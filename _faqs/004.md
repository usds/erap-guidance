title: The Act limits eligibility to households with income that does not exceed 80 percent of the median income for the area in which the household is located, as determined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), but does not provide a definition of household income. How is household income defined for purposes of the ERA program? How will income be documented and verified?

*Definition of Income*: With respect to each household applying for assistance, grantees may choose between using HUD’s definition of [“annual income” in 24 CFR 5.6092](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div5&node=24:1.1.1.1.5#se24.1.5_1609) and using adjusted gross income as defined for purposes of reporting under Internal Revenue Service Form 1040 series for individual federal annual income tax purposes.

*Methods for Income Determination*: The Act provides that grantees may determine income eligibility based on either (i) the household’s total income for calendar year 2020, or (ii) sufficient confirmation of the household’s monthly income at the time of application, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary).

If a grantee uses a household’s monthly income to determine eligibility, the grantee should review the monthly income information provided at the time of application and extrapolate over a 12-month period to determine whether household income exceeds 80 percent of area median income. For example, if the applicant provides income information for two months, the grantee should multiply it by six to determine the annual amount. If a household qualifies based on monthly income, the grantee must redetermine the household income eligibility every three months for the duration of assistance.

<span id="4p4">*Documentation of Income Determination*: Grantees must have a reasonable basis under the circumstances for determining income. Except as discussed below, this generally requires a written attestation from the applicant as to household income and also documentation available to the applicant to support the determination of income, such as paystubs, W-2s or other wage statements, tax filings, bank statements demonstrating regular income, or an attestation from an employer. As discussed below, under limited circumstances, a grantee may rely on a written attestation from the applicant without further documentation of household income. Grantees have discretion to provide waivers or exceptions to this documentation requirement to accommodate disabilities, extenuating circumstances related to the pandemic, or a lack of technological access. In these cases, the grantee is still responsible for making the required determination regarding the applicant’s household income and documenting that determination.</span>

<span id="4p5">*Categorical Eligibility*: If an applicant’s household income has been verified to be at or below 80 percent of the area median income in connection with another local, state, or federal government assistance program, grantees are permitted to rely on a determination letter from the government agency that verified the applicant’s household income, provided that the determination for such program was made on or after January 1, 2020.</span>

<span id="4p6">*Written Attestation Without Further Documentation*: To the extent that a household’s income, or a portion thereof, is not verifiable due to the impact of COVID-19 (for example, because a place of employment has closed) or has been received in cash, or if the household has no qualifying income, grantees may accept a written attestation from the applicant regarding household income. If such a written attestation without further documentation is relied on, the grantee must reassess household income for such household every three months. In appropriate cases, grantees may rely on an attestation from a caseworker or other professional with knowledge of a household’s circumstances to certify that an applicant’s household income qualifies for assistance.</span>

*Definition of Area Median Income*: The area median income for a household is the same as the income limits for families published in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(2), available under the heading for [“Access Individual Income Limits Areas”.](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html) <sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>

<sup id="fn3">3 Specifically, 80% of area median income is the same as “low income.” For the purpose of prioritizing rental assistance as described in FAQ 22 below, pursuant to section 501(c)(4)(A) of Subdivision N of the Act, 50 percent of the area median income for the household is the same as the “very low-income limit” for the area in question</sup>
