title: What are the applicable limitations on administrative expenses? 
---

The Act provides that not more than 10 percent of the amount paid to a grantee under the ERA program may be used for administrative costs attributable to providing financial assistance and housing stability services to eligible households. 

The revised award term issued by Treasury permits recipients to use funds provided to cover both direct and indirect costs. In accordance with the statutory limitation on administrative costs, the total of all administrative costs incurred by the grantee and all subrecipients, whether direct or indirect costs, may not exceed 10 percent of the total amount of the award provided to the grantee from Treasury. (The grantee may permit a subrecipient to incur more than 10 percent of the amount of the subaward issued to that subrecipient as long as the total of all administrative costs incurred by the grantee and all subrecipients, whether as direct or indirect costs, does not exceed 10 percent of the total amount of the award provided to the grantee from Treasury.)

Further, the revised award term no longer requires grantees to deduct administrative costs charged to the award from the amount available for housing stability services. Rather, any direct and indirect administrative costs must be allocated by the grantee to either the provision of financial assistance or the provision of housing stability services. As required by the Act, not less than 90 percent of the funds received by a grantee shall be used to provide financial assistance to eligible households. Not more than 10 percent of funds received by a grantee may be used to provide eligible households with housing stability services (discussed in FAQ 23). To the extent administrative costs are not readily allocable to one or the other of these categories, the grantee may assume an allocation of the relevant costs of 90 percent to financial assistance and 10 percent to housing stability services.

Grantees may apply their negotiated indirect cost rate to the award but only to the extent that the total of the amount charged pursuant to that rate and the amount of direct costs charged to the award does not exceed 10 percent of the amount of the award.
