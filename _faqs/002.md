If the grantee is relying on clause (i) for this determination, the grantee is permitted to rely on either a written attestation signed by the applicant or other relevant documentation regarding the household member’s qualification for unemployment benefits. If the grantee is relying on clause (ii) for this determination, the Act requires the grantee to obtain a written attestation signed by the applicant that one or more members of the household meets this condition.
