title: Is there a limit on financial assistance for prospective rent?
---

Yes. Under the Act, financial assistance for prospective rent payments is limited to three months based on any application by or on behalf of the household, except that the household may receive assistance for prospective rent payments for additional months (i) subject to the availability of remaining funds currently allocated to the grantee, and (ii) based on a subsequent application for additional assistance provided that the total months of assistance provided to the household do not exceed 12 months (plus an additional three months if necessary to ensure housing stability for the household, subject to the availability of funds).
