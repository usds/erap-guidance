title: May rental assistance be provided to temporarily displaced households living in hotels or motels? 
category: What an ERA program can pay for
---

Yes. The cost of a hotel or motel room occupied by an eligible household may be covered using ERA assistance within the category of certain “other expenses related to housing” (as described in <a href="#7">FAQ 7</a>) provided that:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
  <li>the household has been temporarily or permanently displaced from its primary residence or does not have a permanent residence elsewhere;</li>
  <li>the total months of assistance provided to the household do not exceed the applicable time limit described in <a href="#10">FAQ 10</a>; and</li>
  <li>documentation of the hotel or motel stay is provided and the other applicable requirements provided in the statute and these FAQs are met.</li>
</ol>

The cost of the hotel or motel stay would not include expenses incidental to the charge for the room. 

Grantees covering the cost of such stays must develop policies and procedures detailing under what circumstances they would provide assistance to cover such stays. In doing so, grantees should consider the cost effectiveness of offering assistance for this purpose as compared to other uses. If a household is eligible for an existing program with narrower eligibility criteria that can provide similar assistance for hotel or motel stays, such as the HUD Emergency Solutions Grant program or FEMA Public Assistance, grantees should utilize such programs prior to providing similar assistance under the ERA program.
