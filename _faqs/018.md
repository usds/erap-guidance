Yes. A grantee may provide assistance to households for which the grantee is the landlord, provided that the grantee complies with the all provisions of the statute establishing ERA1 or ERA2, as applicable, the award terms, and applicable ERA guidance issued by Treasury, and (for purposes of ERA1) that no preferences beyond those outlined in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, are given to households that reside in the granteeâ€™s own properties.
