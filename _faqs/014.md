category: Documentation Requirements
---

Treasury will provide instructions at a later time as to what information grantees must report to Treasury and how this information must be reported. At a minimum, in order to ensure that Treasury is able to fulfill its quarterly reporting requirements under section 501(g) of Division N of the Act and its ongoing monitoring and oversight responsibilities, grantees should anticipate the need to collect from households and retain records on the following: 

* Address of the rental unit;
* For landlords and utility providers, the name, address, and Social Security number, tax identification number or DUNS number;
* Amount and percentage of monthly rent covered by ERA assistance;
* Amount and percentage of separately stated utility and home energy costs covered by ERA assistance;
* Total amount of each type of assistance provided to each household (i.e., rent, rental arrears, utilities and home energy costs, utilities and home energy costs arrears, and other expenses related to housing incurred due directly or indirectly to the COVID-19 outbreak);
* Amount of outstanding rental arrears for each household;
* Number of months of rental payments and number of months of utility or home energy cost payments for which ERA assistance is provided;
* Household income and number of individuals in the household; and
* Gender, race, and ethnicity of the primary applicant for assistance.

Grantees should also collect information as to the number of applications received in order to be able to report to Treasury the acceptance rate of applicants for assistance.

Treasury’s Office of Inspector General may require the collection of additional information in order to fulfill its oversight and monitoring requirements. <sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> Treasury will provide additional information regarding reporting to Treasury at a future date. Grantees must comply with the requirement in section 501(g)(4) of Division N of the of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, to establish data privacy and security requirements for information they collect; grantees under ERA2 are also encouraged to comply with those requirements. <sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> 

The assistance listing number assigned to the ERA program is 21.023.

  7 Specifically, the statute establishing ERA1 requires grantees to establish data privacy and security requirements for certain information regarding applicants that (i) include appropriate measures to ensure that the privacy of the individuals and households is protected; (ii) provide that the information, including any personally identifiable information, is collected and used only for the purpose of submitting reports to Treasury; and (iii) provide confidentiality protections for data collected about any individuals who are survivors of intimate partner violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
