title: How should a grantee determine that an individual within a household is at risk of experiencing homelessness or housing instability?
category: eligibility
---

The statutes establishing ERA1 and ERA2 both require that one or more individuals within the household can demonstrate a risk of experiencing homelessness or housing instability. Such a demonstration may include (i) a past due utility or rent notice or eviction notice, (ii) unsafe or unhealthy living conditions (which may include overcrowding), or (iii) any other evidence of risk, as determined by the grantee.  Grantees may establish alternative criteria for determining whether a household satisfies this requirement, and should adopt policies and procedures addressing how they will determine the presence of unsafe or unhealthy living conditions and what evidence of risk to accept in order to support their determination that a household satisfies this requirement.  A grantee may rely on an applicantâ€™s self-certification identifying the applicable risk factor or factors, without further documentation, if other documentation is not immediately available.
