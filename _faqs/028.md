category: pay
---

Rental payments for either the manufactured home and/or the parcel of land the manufactured home occupies are eligible for financial assistance under ERA programs. Households renting manufactured housing and/or the parcel of land the manufactured home occupies may also receive assistance for utilities and other expenses related to housing, as detailed in <a href="#7">FAQ 7</a> above. This principle also applies to mooring fees for water-based dwellings (houseboats).
