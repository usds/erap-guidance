ERA funds may be used to provide assistance to eligible households to cover prospective relocation assistance, rent, and utility or home energy costs, including after an eviction. Treasury encourages grantees to provide prospective support to help ensure housing stability. See <a href="#7">FAQ 7</a> (regarding qualifying relocation expenses) and <a href="#10">FAQ 10</a> (regarding time limits on assistance).
