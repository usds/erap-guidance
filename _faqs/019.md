title: May a grantee provide assistance to a renter household with respect to utility or energy costs without also covering rent?
---

Yes. A grantee is not required to provide assistance with respect to rent in order to provide assistance with respect to utility or energy costs. The limitations in section 501(c)(2)(B) of Division N of the Act limiting assistance for prospective rent payments do not apply to the provision of utilities or home energy costs.
