category: What an ERA program can pay for
---

ERA1 and ERA2 have different requirements for housing stability services.

Under ERA1, these funds may be used to provide eligible households with case management and other services related to the COVID-19 outbreak, as defined by the Secretary, intended to help keep households stably housed.

Under ERA2, these services do not have to be related to the COVID-19 outbreak.

For purposes of ERA1 and ERA2, housing stability services include those that enable eligible households to maintain or obtain housing. Such services may include housing counseling, fair housing counseling, case management related to housing stability, housing related services for survivors of domestic abuse or human trafficking, legal services or attorneyâ€™s fees related to eviction proceedings and maintaining housing stability, and specialized services for individuals with disabilities or seniors that supports their ability to access or maintain housing. Grantees using ERA funds for housing stability services must maintain records regarding such services and the amount of funds provided to them.
