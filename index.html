          <h3>Keeping Families in their Homes</h3>

          <p>
            The Emergency Rental Assistance program makes available $25 billion
            to assist households that are unable to pay rent and utilities due
            to the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp; The funds are provided directly to
            States, U.S. Territories, local governments, and Indian
            tribes.&nbsp; Grantees use the funds to provide assistance to
            eligible households through existing or newly created rental
            assistance programs.
          </p>

          <h3>Information for Governments</h3>
          <p>
            Emergency Rental Assistance payments will be made directly to States
            (including the District of Columbia), U.S. Territories (Puerto Rico,
            the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the
            Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa), local governments
            with more than 200,000 residents, the Department of Hawaiian Home
            Lands, and Indian tribes (defined to include Alaska native
            corporations) or the tribally designated housing entity of an Indian
            tribe, as applicable (collectively the “eligible
            grantees”).<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Details on the data and
            methodology used to determine allocations for states, local
            governments and territories may be accessed below.&nbsp; Details on
            the data and methodology and payments for tribal communities also
            may be accessed below.<br /><br />
            A list of eligible local governments, which includes a county,
            municipality, town, township, village, parish, borough, or other
            unit of general government below the State level with a population
            that exceeds 200,000, may be accessed below.<br /><br />
            Eligible grantees must provide payment information and sign the
            acceptance of award terms form accessible below.&nbsp; The award
            terms are available for review, and may be accessed below.&nbsp;
            Prospective grantees should review in full the statutory provisions

            Completed payment information and a signed acceptance of award terms
            form generally must be submitted not later than 11:59 p.m. EDT on
            January 12, 2021, to ensure payments are made within the 30-day
            period specified by the statute.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Eligible
            grantees that do not provide complete information by 11:59 p.m. EDT
            on January 12, 2021, may not receive an Emergency Rental Assistance
            payment.&nbsp; To the extent any tribes or tribally-designated
            housing entities do not elect to participate in the program by
            providing the required payment materials, Treasury is required to
            reallocate those funds to those tribes that have elected to
            participate in the program.&nbsp;<br /><br />
            Not less than 90 percent of awarded funds must be used for direct
            financial assistance, including rent, rental arrears, utilities and
            home energy costs, utilities and home energy costs arrears, and
            other expenses related to housing.&nbsp; Remaining funds are
            available for housing stability services, including case management
            and other services intended to keep households stably housed.&nbsp;
            Funds generally expire on September 30, 2022.&nbsp;<span

          <h3>program information</h3>

          <h4>Eligibility</h4>

          <p>
            An “eligible household” is defined as a renter household in which at
            least one or more individuals meets the following criteria:
          </p>

          <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
            <li>
              Qualifies for unemployment or has experienced a reduction in
              household income, incurred significant costs, or experienced a
              financial hardship due to COVID-19;
            </li>
            <li>
              Demonstrates a risk of experiencing homelessness or housing
              instability; and
            </li>
            <li>
              Has a household income at or below 80 percent of the area median.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <br />
            Rental assistance provided to an eligible household should not be
            duplicative of any other federally funded rental assistance provided
            to such household.<br /><br />
            Eligible households that include an individual who has been
            unemployed for the 90 days prior to application for assistance and
            households with income at or below 50 percent of the area median are
            to be prioritized for assistance.&nbsp;<br /><br />
            Household income is determined as either the household’s total
            income for calendar year 2020 or the household’s monthly income at
            the time of application.&nbsp; For household incomes determined
            using the latter method, income eligibility must be redetermined
            every 3 months.
          </p>

          <h4>Available Assistance</h4>

          <p>
            Eligible households may receive up to 12 months of assistance, plus
            an additional 3 months if the grantee determines the extra months
            are needed to ensure housing stability and grantee funds are
            available.&nbsp; The payment of existing housing-related arrears
            that could result in eviction of an eligible household is
            prioritized.&nbsp; Assistance must be provided to reduce an eligible
            household’s rental arrears before the household may receive
            assistance for future rent payments.&nbsp; Once a household’s rental
            arrears are reduced, grantees may only commit to providing future
            assistance for up to three months at a time.&nbsp; Households may
            reapply for additional assistance at the end of the three-month
            period if needed and the overall time limit for assistance is not
            exceeded.
          </p>

          <h4>Application Process</h4>

          <p>
            An application for rental assistance may be submitted by either an
            eligible household or by a landlord on behalf of that eligible
            household.&nbsp; Households and landlords must apply through
            programs established by grantees.&nbsp; In general, funds will be
            paid directly to landlords and utility service providers.&nbsp; If a
            landlord does not wish to participate, funds may be paid directly to
            the eligible household.&nbsp;<strong
              >Treasury cannot process applications from households and
              landlords. Please review the list of eligible grantees below and
              contact your state, local, or Tribal grant recipient for
              information on how to apply.</strong
            ><br />
            &nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Transparency</h3>

          <p>
            The Department of the Treasury will issue public reports quarterly
            on the use of funds.&nbsp; The Treasury Office of Inspector General
            will conduct oversight of the program and may recoup funds from any
            government that fails to comply with the restrictions on the use of
            funds.
          </p>

              >On March 26, 2021, Treasury revised its FAQs and Grantee Award
              Terms for Emergency Rental Assistance. Treasury continues to work

              assistance, which will be forthcoming.</strong
