title: Data collection for reporting to Treasury
---

Treasury will provide instructions soon for what information grantees must report to Treasury and how to report it. At a minimum, to ensure that Treasury can fulfill its quarterly reporting requirements under section 501(g) of Division N of the Act and its ongoing monitoring and oversight responsibilities, expect to collect from households and retain records on the following:

*	Address of the rental unit;
*	For landlords and utility providers, the name, address, and Social Security number, tax identification number or DUNS number;
*	Amount and percentage of monthly rent covered by ERA assistance;
*	Amount and percentage of separately stated utility and home energy costs covered by ERA assistance;
*	Total amount of each type of assistance provided to each household (i.e., rent, rental arrears, utilities and home energy costs, utilities and home energy costs arrears, and other expenses related to housing incurred due directly or indirectly to the COVID-19 pandemic);
*	Amount of outstanding rental arrears for each household;
*	Number of months of rental payments and number of months of utility or home energy cost payments for which ERA assistance is provided;
*	Household income and number of individuals in the household; and
*	Gender, race, and ethnicity of the primary applicant for assistance.

You should also track the number of applications received so you can report to Treasury the acceptance rate of applicants for assistance. 

Treasuryâ€™s Office of Inspector General may require the collection of additional information so it can fulfill its oversight and monitoring requirements. 

Treasury will provide additional information regarding reporting to Treasury at a future date. 

Your program must establish data privacy and security requirements for information you collect. Document this in your policies and procedures.  

The assistance listing number assigned to the ERA program is 21.023.
