Emergency Rental Assistance payments will be made directly to States (including the District of Columbia), U.S. Territories (Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa), local governments with more than 200,000 residents, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, and Indian tribes (defined to include Alaska native corporations) or the tribally designated housing entity of an Indian tribe, as applicable (collectively the “eligible grantees”).<sup>1</sup> Details on the data and methodology used to determine allocations for states, local governments and territories may be accessed below. Details on the data and methodology and payments for tribal communities also may be accessed below.

A list of eligible local governments, which includes a county, municipality, town, township, village, parish, borough, or other unit of general government below the State level with a population that exceeds 200,000, may be accessed below.

Completed payment information and a signed acceptance of award terms form generally must be submitted not later than 11:59 p.m. EDT on January 12, 2021, to ensure payments are made within the 30-day period specified by the statute.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Eligible grantees that do not provide complete information by 11:59 p.m. EDT on January 12, 2021, may not receive an Emergency Rental Assistance payment.&nbsp; To the extent any tribes or tribally-designated housing entities do not elect to participate in the program by providing the required payment materials, Treasury is required to reallocate those funds to those tribes that have elected to participate in the program.

Not less than 90 percent of awarded funds must be used for direct financial assistance, including rent, rental arrears, utilities and home energy costs, utilities and home energy costs arrears, and other expenses related to housing.&nbsp; Remaining funds are available for housing stability services, including case management and other services intended to keep households stably housed.&nbsp; Funds generally expire on September 30, 2022.

For ease of reference, the assistance listing number (CDFA number) assigned to the ERA program is 21.023.

## Transparency

The Department of the Treasury will issue public reports quarterly on the use of funds. The Treasury Office of Inspector General will conduct oversight of the program and may recoup funds from any government that fails to comply with the restrictions on the use of funds.
