title: Partnerships in Program Implementation
---

Many grantees who have quickly implemented their ERA programs were able to do so by leveraging existing local partnerships with nonprofits and community organizations already working on housing stability issues. These local organizations are integrated into the community and can provide holistic support across a variety housing stability, food security, financial, and health services. Some grantees have made efforts to integrate their ERA programs into "one program" with other relevant services, allowing program providers to identify appropriate resources to address the full range of applicants' needs.

Grantees that reported strong partnerships with nonprofit program providers emphasized that these relationships rely on building a shared vision and infrastructure that supports continuous communication about ERA program development, program requirements and definitions, and the flow of ERA applications/payments. 

Partnerships between grantees have also allowed for more consistent application experiences within the locality.  In some cases, grantees have found administrative economies of scale by partnering with neighboring grantees or overlapping jurisdictions. Partnerships between grantees can ensure that funds reach the highest need communities while guarding against awarding duplicative benefits to residents.
