<span class="usa-tag usa-tag--new">New</span> A key tool in ensuring that taxpayer funds are being used appropriately is periodic audits. Certainly, Treasury’s Office of the Inspector General will review reported data from local programs and conduct some audits of some programs. However, local programs should also conduct their own internal audits. 

## Preventing mistakes

Program staff – from the local government in charge of the program, to vendors, to community-based organizations who are partners – do occasionally make mistakes. By close tracking and reviews, you can usually detect and correct mistakes that persist.

*	Hold occasional “refresher” training covering trouble spots and with updates to operations or systems. 
*	Visit field offices where vendors and partners are working, and ask workers to show you how they process applications. 
*	Conduct usability testing of forms for applicants and tools for workers. Revise forms and tools to remedy confusion and mistakes. 

## Preventing internal fraud

Occasionally, workers, vendors, or partners may be tempted to take advantage of the generosity of the government. There are often signs that individuals or organizations are misspending funds or misusing them. The single best way to prevent internal fraud is to implement internal controls based on guidance from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. <a href="https://www.hudoig.gov/sites/default/files/2019-04/Internal%20Controls%20Integrity%20Bulletin%20CPD.pdf">HUD’s “Integrity Bulletin” of Fall 2016</a> is an excellent resource.

## Preventing applicant fraud

While most applicants are truly in need of the assistance this program offers, you may encounter applicants who are not <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>. 
 
* **Intercept fraudulent applications at application time.** Especially in digital applications, it is important to verify identity of the applicant. Ideally, you should use multiple datasets to cross-match applicants to real people or properties, where at all possible. 
*	**Check the authenticity of documentation.** We encourage you to allow photocopies, digital photos, or scans of supporting documentation – but you must check that the landlord, utility, and address information is real.
*	**Set up data and systems to detect and report unusual patterns.** With rampant identity theft out in the world, it’s easy for even a small syndicate to set up automated processes that set up accounts and apply for fraudulent benefits. Set up your systems to detect evidence of inappropriate and fraudulent claims. You can often see patterns in the types of applicants coming through. For example, a landlord gets paid for more units than they actually own; both tenants and landlords apply and receive duplicate benefits.
*	**Review self-attested applications carefully leading up to renewal / extension times.** Some applicants who self-attest to income or rent amounts may be under-reporting income or over-reporting rental obligations. Requiring reviews every three months is meant to give applicants time to find appropriate supporting documentation.
*	**Train program workers** to recognize flags of inauthentic applications and documentation, and encourage them to report issues when they arise.
