An application for rental assistance may be submitted by either an eligible household or by a landlord on behalf of that eligible household. Households and landlords must apply through programs established by grantees. In general, funds will be paid directly to landlords and utility service providers. If a landlord does not wish to participate, funds may be paid directly to the eligible household. <strong>Treasury cannot process applications from households and landlords. Please review the list of eligible grantees below and contact your state, local, or Tribal grant recipient for information on how to apply.</strong>
