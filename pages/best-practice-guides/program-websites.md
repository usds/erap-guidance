title: Best practices for program web sites
---

<p class="usa-intro">
  It is important that renters and landlords are able to both find and understand the rental assistance that you are offering. The provided information must clearly explain the purpose of the assistance, as well as what is needed to apply and what can be expected in return.  
</p>
<p>
  To help accomplish these goals, Treasury has prepared this “best practices” guide.  It was created in conjunction with the <a href="https://usds.gov/">U. S. Digital Service</a> to help Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program grantees with developing web sites and web pages to inform renters<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>, landlords, and utility providers about the ERA program. <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
</p>

## Important principles to keep in mind

* Your ERA program should be easy to find.
* Your ERA program should explain that the purpose of the assistance is to keep people in their homes by providing financial assistance for the payment of rent, rental arrears, utilities and home energy costs, utilities and home energy costs arrears, and other costs related to housing, housing stability services, and as applicable, cover other affordable rental housing and eviction prevention activities.
* Online and printed information should be clear about was is needed from the renter or landlord, what they will get in return, and for how long.
* Ideally, your program will enable the renter or landlord to apply and receive assistance with as few steps as possible.

### How to make your program easy to find

First and foremost, all grantees should provide:

* **A central landing page** that provides the key information an applicant needs to apply.
* **A single and easily remembered URL** where the page is hosted. 

Learn more about what to put on your landing page in the "What to include on your ERA page" section. 

Example URL patterns that are short, concise, and easy for potential applicants to remember and share include:

* rentrelief.[state].gov
* housing.[state].gov
* [city].gov/rental-assistance/
* era.[county or city].gov

If necessary, make this single URL an alias that redirects the potential applicants to another page or site with a longer URL.

Finally, if you are providing information on your website, but potential applicants cannot actually apply online, state that limitation clearly along with the email address or phone number to contact your office to begin the application process. It is important for potential applicants to have the necessary information to apply for assistance.

Also, if your application submission period has ended, provide potential applicants information about whether the application process may be reopened, if applicable. It is also advisable to provide information about alternative programs that may provide similar or related assistance.  

## What to include on your ERA web page

### Summary

Start with a summary or overview addressing the basic who, what, when, where, why, and how of the program. This section should be brief and highlight the most relevant parts of the program information with the details and specifics to be more fully described in the separate sections described below.  

* **Who** the program is for
* **What** types of assistance are available
* **When** are applications being accepted
* **Where** and **how** a renter or landlord can apply, what they should expect next, **where** to get help with their application, and **how** to check the status of an application that has already been filed
* **Why** the program was created
* **How** the program works 

### Who is eligible to apply

After the summary, develop an application section explaining who is eligible to apply.

* Include an AMI table or calculator to help a household determine if they are eligible to receive assistance.
* For renters or landlords that are deemed ineligible for assistance under the ERA program, if available, provide a link to other resources available in the area for housing and utility assistance.
* Redirect homeowners to available mortgage assistance programs. 
* Provide information for utility providers so that they can cooperate with your program and contact information so that they may reach out in order to setup a data sharing agreement.

### What types of assistance are available

Discuss the types of assistance available to renters and landlords including any important limitations regarding the amount of assistance that can be offered. For example, Emergency Rental Assistance funds cannot cover rent accrued prior to March 13, 2020. Explain how your program will address the following: 

* Current rent
* Rental arrears
* Utilities and home energy costs
* Utilities and home energy cost arrears
* Internet services
* Relocation expenses
* Rental security deposits
* Rental fees (application and screening fees)

### Documents to gather

This information should address each audience &mdash; renters and landlords &mdash; separately. [Mixing material intended for different audiences may confuse readers](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/audience/address-separate-audiences-separately/). Thus, you should place this information within distinct sections of your web page, on separate pages, and/or early in the application process if separate application forms or procedures have been designed for renters and landlords. Be sure to address the following points:

* **Why is the documentation necessary**: For example, "Your application will be processed more quickly if you can provide the following documents."
* **Which documentation is required and which are alternative forms**: If self-attestation can be used instead of a certain document, be clear about that option.
* **What will be done with the information:** It is also critical to address privacy concerns.  This section should detail how the applicant’s information will be used, who it will be shared with, and what information will or will not be shared.

### When applications are being accepted

Be clear if applications are or are not currently being accepted. If applications are not currently being accepted, indicate when the program will begin, reopen, or if the program accepts applications in cycles.

### How to apply

This section should clearly confirm whether the potential applicant is in the right place to apply. Be sure to include the following

#### One or two large, clear, "Apply" buttons
* Many grantees provide separate application buttons for renters and landlords.
* Applicants need a clear call-to-action. The "apply" button will be the one element applicants are looking for above all else so don't make it difficult to find or small enough to miss. A large button will do the trick.
* Ideally, clicking "apply" will take the applicant to the start of the online application. However, it is also appropriate to link the button to an intake form, application queue, or PDF application form.

#### Alternative ways to apply
* Beneath the "apply" button link to another section on alternative ways to apply.
* Not all applicants will be capable of applying online and will require an alternative method to apply. Some applicants will have irregular computer access, may be uncomfortable with providing personal information over the internet, or are inquiring on behalf of another person.

#### If appropriate, advise where else to seek assistance
* If households, utility providers, or landlords first sought assistance from a different grantee (the state, county, city, or Tribal government) and were found to be ineligible, this section should redirect them to other resources available in the area for housing and utility assistance accordingly. In these situations, the “apply” button may link to the other grantee’s webpage.

### What to expect next

In this section provide the following information:

* The timeline for when applications will be processed
* How you will prioritize or work through applications
* When applicants should expect to hear from you next
* When applicants should expect to receive assistance
* How an applicant can track the status of their application

### Where to get help

In this section detail methods for providing applicants with help creating or tracking an application. Some potential avenues include:

* A central E-mail account for application support questions
* Numbers for phone or text inquiries
* In-person help centers

### Why the program was created

This section should further clarify the program's intent and discuss how it may relate to prior rental assistance programs. Providing this context can help potential applicants who may have applied before and may have questions about the types of assistance and how much assistance is being offered.

### How the program works

This section can also help provide background context for decisions made about how assistance is being prioritized and the length of the program.

## Other items to address or include

* Include translation capabilities or other appropriate avenues <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/faqs/#37">for ensuring the information is easily available</a> to all tenants, landlords, and utility providers in your area regardless of their primary language.
* Application checklists identifying all information and documents the applicant will need to provide.
* Some qualified applicants will not be able to access or will not feel comfortable completing the ERA application online. To ensure that all eligible applicants have equal access to apply for assistance under the ERA program it's important to provide an alternate means of applying, such as a paper form or with support from ERA counselors. Some grantees have contracted with 2-1-1 systems or provided phone numbers for specialized ERA housing counselors.
* Information around federal and state taxes. The [IRS has provided answers to federal tax questions](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/emergency-rental-assistance-frequently-asked-questions).
* Additional housing and homeowner resources.
* A "frequently asked questions" section addressing any local issues, special concerns, and/or further clarifying your program guidance.

## Providing information about your ERA program in plain language

The [federal government has resources on writing in plain language](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/) which you may find helpful. It is important to:

* Write for your audience
* Organize the information
* Choose your words carefully
* Be concise
* Keep it conversational
* Design for reading
* Follow web standards
* Test your assumptions

You may also want to consider the [Snack, Bite, Meal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bite,_snack_and_meal) approach to writing content. This method presents information in three forms, each a bit longer and more detailed than the previous:

1. **Bite**: A headline sentence or two.
2. **Snack**: A summary or abstract of the information.
3. **Meal**: The full details.

## Examples of ERA grantee program web sites

We've provided a few examples here of state, local, and tribal government web sites that follow some of the best practices detailed above. We hope you'll find these a useful reference point <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>.
