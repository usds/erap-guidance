title: Promising practices for ERA programs
---

<p>
  The U.S. Treasury Department has made billions of dollars available to state, local and tribal government agencies to provide emergency rental assistance to help qualified renters cover their housing-related costs during the pandemic. As a result, localities across the United States have been working hard to stand up their Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) programs in order to address the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on millions of American renters.  Each ERA grantee has some flexibility to develop their rental assistance program to suit the needs of their local community, while complying with requirements outlined in their ERA financial assistance agreement, the ERA statute, and Treasury’s guidelines.

<p>
  Treasury has engaged with ERA grantees across the country to identify program strategies that promise to speed up program implementation, more efficiently  deliver program benefits, enhance program integrity, and improve tenant and landlord access to programs—particularly for vulnerable and harder to reach populations. As grantees across the country build program infrastructures designed to meet the specific needs of their local communities, many have reported that early successes have relied on leveraging local resources, data-driven operational analyses, and incorporating continuous operational improvement strategies into their regular practices. Specific promising practices to reach residents most in need of ERA benefits and enhance program efficiency include <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>:

### Partnerships in Program Implementation 

Many grantees that have quickly implemented their ERA programs were able to do so by leveraging existing local partnerships with nonprofits and community organizations already working on housing stability issues. These local organizations are integrated into the community and can provide holistic support across a variety housing stability, food insecurity, financial, and health services. Some grantees have made efforts to integrate their ERA programs into “one program” with other housing stability services, allowing program providers to identify appropriate resources to address the full range of individual applicant’s needs.

Grantees that reported strong partnerships with nonprofit program providers emphasized that these relationships rely on building a shared vision and infrastructure that supports continuous communication about ERA program development, program requirements and definitions, and the flow of ERA applications/payments. 

Partnerships between grantees have also allowed for more consistent application experiences within the locality.  In some cases, grantees have found administrative economies of scale by partnering with neighboring grantees or overlapping jurisdictions. Partnerships between grantees can ensure that funds reach the highest need communities while guarding against awarding duplicative benefits to residents.

#### Examples

**Charlotte, NC** has developed a highly collaborative relationship with a local affordable housing nonprofit. Information collected from the nonprofit feeds into a data-system that keeps city administrators informed about program outcomes. The city and nonprofit have regular communications, and the city maintains a regular schedule of program auditing to support quality control and real-time problem solving to continually adjust to changing programmatic needs.

**Montgomery County, PA** has incorporated their ERA program into a preexisting network of homelessness prevention activities. Outreach and program implementation occur through community-based nonprofit organizations that specialize in working with low income households.  These organizations maintain a common information system and use the local housing crisis response’s Coordinated Entry system, which connects applicants with a range of relevant services and programs. 

**The state of Ohio** implements their ERA program through the Community Action Coalition, representing 47 non-profits across the state that offer a range of services. These organizations use a common backend system that helps to align program requirements and guard against duplication of benefit allocation. The state regularly coordinates communications about program challenges and best practices, creating channel for more efficiently cultivating program development. 

**Clark County, North Las Vegas and the City of Henderson** created the CARES Housing Assistance Program (CHAP) and work together through local non-profits sharing a common data system online. These non-profits have also managed hiring temporary staff to help with application processing, allowing the programs to more easily scale depending on application volume. 

### Culturally and Linguistically Competent Outreach

Across the country, grantees are identifying strategies to reach communities where residents were disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Most grantees incorporate Spanish translation services into their application processes, some offering support in multiple languages. Most also have expanded the availability of their ERA application by supporting multiple channels for residents to apply, especially through complementing an online application with access to call center application support through 211 partnerships and/or phone-based access to housing counselors.

Some grantees have identified significant benefits in partnering with trusted local organizations with high levels of local cultural and linguistic competencies.  Intentional partnerships with trusted organizations can especially help support outreach efforts to serve harder to reach populations that face technological, cultural, and linguistic barriers to ERA participation. These partnerships can be especially critical when working with immigrant populations, the elderly, survivors of domestic violence or human trafficking, and other marginalized communities.  In some cases, these organizations have provided in-person application support while maintaining social distancing protocols.

Many grantees have reported that these partnerships are occurring when their non-profit partners sub-contract and engage with smaller non-profits that work with specific vulnerable populations that were disproportionally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### Examples

**The city of San Antonio** has been intentional in contracting with nonprofits to reach target populations. They have started contracting with a collaborative of local healthcare organizations, which in turn works with 20 nonprofit grassroots organizations who have deep ties to the community. For instance, one of these partners is an organization that provides various support services to domestic workers and has strong ties to the local Spanish-speaking community. Administrators have noted that nonprofits trained to conduct in-person outreach (while maintaining social distancing health standards) are particularly helpful partners, such as those who have contracted to do census outreach.

While **the State of Maine** has translated their application and program materials into eight languages, program administrators have found that building partnerships with cultural brokers are critical to engagement with local immigrant populations. For instance, partnerships with local organizations focused on Somali immigrants have helped the program identify more specific services that can help these households successfully navigate the ERA program while also providing a bridge to other relevant Health and Human Services programs offered by the state. 

**The State of Illinois** has started working on program outreach efforts through a network of churches that also supported the state’s COVID-relief efforts. The State of North Carolina has noted that partnering with Black churches within the state is critical to its community outreach efforts.  These partnerships demonstrate that church networks can serve as strong partners to educate communities about ERA programs.    

**Richland County** in South Carolina has found strong partnerships opportunities with county’s thirteen libraries spread out across the county. In addition to providing convenient centers of support to residents, the library system also has a preexisting relationship with local social workers. This network has provided the ERA program administrators an opportunity to train the existing network professionals to educate residents about the ERA program. This effort has led to increased accessibility of professional and holistic support for households in need of ERA services, while also providing applicants to the free online access and other resources.

### Intentional Landlord Engagement

Landlords are a critical beneficiary and stakeholder of the ERA program. Many grantees have reached out to landlord associations to build working relationships and identify participation barriers for landlords. Regular conversations with small, medium-sized and large landlord representatives, as well as public housing entities, are often reported as critical in garnering landlord participation. In some cases, grantees have asked their culturally and linguistically competent partners to incorporate landlord outreach into their targeted outreach efforts since tenants and landlords often live within the same communities and have similar application support needs. 

These proactive landlord communications have also been critical to landlord participation when grantees require landlords to make concessions or commitments to providing the tenant with some assurance of housing stability. Further, many grantees have found that creating separate applications for landlords and tenants have met landlord’s needs for a streamlined process and created operational efficiencies for grantees. 

#### Examples

**The Kentucky Housing Corp** engaged in proactive outreach to area landlords.  These conversations inspired regional grantee collaboration to align application requirements and forms, creating more predictable program processes for landlords and improving their participation rates.

**The State of Massachusetts’s ERA program** has started a system to reduce some paperwork requirement regarding income eligibility when the tenant lives in financed housing.  They have also developed a system to make batched payments to larger landlords.  Approximately two-thirds of Massachusetts’s ERA applications live in subsidized housing units, and these batched payments allow many tenants and landlords to more efficiently receive ERA assistance.  

### Partnerships with Broader Eviction Diversion Programs

Many grantees have found that partnerships with the local court systems and legal services are critical tools in preventing housing insecurity and helping landlords recover from built-up rental arrears.  While the court systems and eviction processes vary across different states and localities, many grantees have found that proactively engaging with local courts, legal aid organizations, and other stakeholders involved in the eviction process can help to reach renters most at risk of housing instability.  Many programs have developed systems where renters facing eviction in the court system have lower documentation requirements to prove eligibility for ERA funds. 

These programs are often complementary to the broader program and expedite ERA applications where the landlord has started the evictions process.  Many of these programs seek to avoid eviction at the earliest stage in the process as possible, include support from legal service professionals and eviction mediators, and sometimes use data gathered through the court system to spur targeted outreach to landlords and/or high-need geographic areas.  

#### Examples

**The City of Memphis and Shelby County** has developed a data sharing relationship with the local court system that allows for program administrators to have real-time information about neighborhoods with increased numbers of evictions and engage in more targeted tenant and landlord outreach. This program also engages volunteers from the local law school to help tenants with pending eviction notices and expedites ERA applications that come through these channels, which has led to many households facing imminent eviction maintain housing stability. 

**The State of Massachusetts** has developed a two-tiered eviction process that has integrated the ERA program into eviction proceedings. In the first tier, landlords and tenants work with a mediator who can direct them to ERA programs to cover qualified rental arrears. This state-funded program also engages legal aid to represent tenants and housing reinstatement services for those who experience eviction. 

**The City of Philadelphia’s ERA program** is also integrated directly into the city’s eviction court system.  The court requires application for the city’s ERA program before allowing the eviction to proceed. 

### Collaboration with Local Utility Companies

In some localities, grantees are finding engaging with the local utility companies can enhance efficiencies within the program, as well as to help market utility assistance to those in need.  In some cases, utility companies can help communicate with potential ERA applications about benefits of the program. 

Thoughtful deployment of data collected through online applications can also help provide more immediate relief to applicants when strategically shared with landlords and utility companies.

#### Example 

In **City of Memphis and Shelby County**, the city has developed a partnership with the local utility company to automatically identify indebted renters who have started ERA applications. Program administrators send notifications to the utility company via batched process, and the renter automatically receives a grace period on utility payments while the ERA application is finalized. This expedites the effectiveness of the application even before the program administers funds to address the tenants' debts. 

### Adjusting Program Strategies to Meet Local Needs 

Many grantees have noted that continuous improvement and nimble outreach strategies have been critical to program implementation. Sensitivity to the challenges faced by the locality’s ERA applications can allow grantees to pivot to more effective strategies. 

#### Examples

**The City of Phoenix, AZ** noted that incorporating experienced local community action representatives who are sensitive to the challenges of the local populations into the oversight of the application process has been critical to raising application completion rates.  Program administrators commented that these representatives have allowed the program to problem solve around application challenges and improve training of line staff.   

The CHAP program, representing the **Clark County, NV and the cities of Henderson and North Las Vegas**, for instance, launched a “re-education” campaign social media designed to reach constituents who may have been discouraged by prior program policies that left them ineligible for funds in the past.

Though not yet implemented within the ERA programs, some grantees have prior experiences with direct-to-tenant payments through CARES Act funds that may be helpful in future iterations of the ERA program. For instance, the **city of Los Angeles** addressed the logistical payment challenges of having a large underbanked population by implementing a pre-paid "Angelino" debit card for tenant-based payments. This strategy helped recipients avoid losing a percentage of the funds through check-cashing services and provided a bridge to having a more formal bank account that could be used in future transactions. 

### Making the Application Process Simple and User Friendly

Many jurisdictions have increased the reach and accessibility of programs by making the application process more user-friendly for both households and landlords. This can include work to simplify the application process – and to make the application itself easily accessible online or in other convenient ways for customers.

#### Examples

**The State of Alaska**, the Municipality of Anchorage and 15 agencies representing 148 federally recognized tribes collaboratively developed a standardized mobile-friendly application system using five non-profit providers from across the state. The application was broken into several stages that each required 3-5 minutes, and the program implemented text messaging functionalities to speed the process.  The collaborative planning and implementation approach led to third of renters within Alaska applied to program with Alaska Native/American Indian applicant represented 28% of responses. 

**The State of Virginia** has outreach efforts using area median income proxies to target outreach to applicants with incomplete applications. Combined with translation services, this targeted and direct outreach helps to push many applications to completion within high-need localities. Program administrators have noted that many applicants had not realized that their applications were not complete, and these outbound efforts have a direct correlation with improvements in application completion.

### Using Fact-Specific Proxies to Establish Applicant Income

Many grantees have also built significant efficiencies within the tenant-facing program application through fact-specific proxies.  Many are exploring additional strategies to expand the use of written attestation to document household income when coupled with other reasonable act-specific proxy for household income, such as reliance on data regarding average incomes in the household’s geographic area. 

#### Example

In **the City of Philadelphia**, the Department of Planning and Development marshalled efforts to quickly build a website, custom application, and back-end database in English and Spanish. This system pulls allows cross-referencing with other government benefit platforms with similar income-eligibility criteria, such as Medicaid or SNAP benefits. These data-driven application strategies can reduce the amount of documentation required by the application to show program eligibility.   

**The States of Indiana and Massachusetts** also have found significant efficiencies by reducing income documentation requirements for applicants who can have eligibility verified through these programs. These programs still require that applicants still complete a self-attestation of meeting the income eligibility and COVID-19 hardship, as well as requiring that applicants show have documentation showing that they owe rent. 

**The State of Kentucky** has started to implement a zip-code based fact-specific proxy to reduce income documentation requirements in high need areas. The state-based grantee worked with Louisville and Lexington to have aligned program design and policies. These shared practices have also helped reduce the administrative burden of the urban county governments.

### Automation Supporting Application Prioritization

Many grantees are using automated systems to help smooth application processing. Some have also implemented additional prioritization considerations beyond the statutory requirements in order to better identify the highest need applicants within their local community. 

#### Examples

**The City of Houston and Harris County** have automated prioritization tiers based upon pre-determined criteria related to renters’ hardship levels, rental situation, and household size. Within prioritized tiers, the program randomly selects applications. Administrators note that moving programs away from a “first come, first serve” strategy supports improved quality of completed applications and ensure that funds reach populations more vulnerable to housing instability.

**The State of Oregon** also has added additional prioritization tiers based on household size, months behind on rent, 2020 wildfire impact, and whether a household lives within a census tract with a high prevalence of low-income renters, using the Urban Institute Rental Priority Index. Through this strategy, Oregon hopes to ensure that ERA funds reach applications in areas disproportionately affected by housing instability due to COVID-19 and to align with Fair Housing principles and practices. 

### Data-Driven Program Strategies

Robust data systems and real-time reporting can be critical in providing real-time learning opportunities to grantees that can help inform continuous improvement efforts.  These data systems also support ongoing reporting to key stakeholders within the community, including local government representatives, the media, and local citizens.  

Many grantees are publicly reporting information about their program outcomes through online dashboards.  While some of these dashboards show simple snapshots of applications processed and dollars paid, many also allow the viewer to see how program inputs and outputs have changed overtime.  Many also show program statistics by county or zip code and across various community demographics. 

#### Examples

**The City of Charlotte, NC**, for instance, has worked with a non-profit partner, to develop a real-time dashboard that show application statuses broken down by key performance, geographic, and demographic measures. Administrators report that the dashboard informs enhanced programmatic strategic decision-making, improves ease of conducting internal audits, and builds trust with local leaders and stakeholders seeking regular programmatic updates. 

**The City of Houston and Harris County** maintains a data system that maps ERA applications and payments and analyzes those payments against a model of what they would expect to be providing to the community based on the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index. These analytics have motivated targeted outreach strategies to underserved communities, such as additional locations for contracted program navigators and Eviction Prevention Drive-Through events.

**The State of Montana and State of Virginia** have also indicated that running weekly analytics across the various program processes have allowed these grantees to identify application bottlenecks and problem-solve, allowing application smoothing and acceleration of application processing. 

Across the country, local grantee administrators are working hard to implement programs to provide rental assistance to their constituents. While this is not an exhaustive list of promising practices, these insights may be useful to ERA grantees as they build out programs to help households maintain their housing, despite the financial uncertainty experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.
