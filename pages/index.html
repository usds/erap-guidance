              <h3>Keeping Families in their Homes</h3>
              <p>
                Even as the American economy continues its recovery from the
                devastating impact of the pandemic, millions of Americans face deep
                rental debt and fear evictions and the loss of basic housing
                security. COVID-19 has exacerbated an affordable housing crisis that
                predated the pandemic and that has exacerbated deep disparities that
                threaten the strength of an economic recovery that must work for
                everyone.
              </p>
              <p>
                To meet this need, the Emergency Rental Assistance program makes
                funding available to assist households that are unable to pay rent
                or utilities. Two separate programs have been established: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/statute/era-1-program-statute-section-501.pdf">ERA1</a>
                provides up to $25 billion under the Consolidated Appropriations
                Act, 2021, which was enacted on December 27, 2020, and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/statute/era-2-program-statute-section-3201.pdf">ERA2</a> provides
                up to $21.55 billion under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021,
                which was enacted on March 11, 2021. The funds are provided directly
                to states, U.S. territories, local governments, and (in the case of
                ERA1) Indian tribes. Grantees use the funds to provide assistance to
                eligible households through existing or newly created rental
                assistance programs.
