          <h3>Keeping Families in their Homes</h3>
          <p>
            Even as the American economy continues its recovery from the
            devastating impact of the pandemic, millions of Americans face deep
            rental debt and fear evictions and the loss of basic housing
            security. COVID-19 has exacerbated an affordable housing crisis that
            predated the pandemic and that has exacerbated deep disparities that
            threaten the strength of an economic recovery that must work for
            everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            To meet this need, the Emergency Rental Assistance program makes
            funding available to assist households that are unable to pay rent
            or utilities. Two separate programs have been established: ERA1
            provides up to $25 billion under the Consolidated Appropriations
            Act, 2021, which was enacted on December 27, 2020, and ERA2 provides
            up to $21.55 billion under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021,
            which was enacted on March 11, 2021. The funds are provided directly
            to states, U.S. territories, local governments, and (in the case of
            ERA1) Indian tribes. Grantees use the funds to provide assistance to
            eligible households through existing or newly created rental
            assistance programs.

          <h3>ERA1 ALLOCATIONS AND PAYMENTS</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 11px">
            ERA1 payments are made directly to states (including the District of
            Columbia), U.S. territories (Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin
            Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and
            American Samoa), local governments with more than 200,000 residents,
            the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, and Indian tribes (defined to
            include Alaska native corporations) or the tribally designated
            housing entity of an Indian tribe, as applicable (collectively the
            “eligible grantees”).<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            At least 90 percent of awarded funds must be used for direct
            financial assistance, including rent, rental arrears, utilities and
            home energy costs, utilities and home energy costs arrears, and
            other expenses related to housing.&nbsp; Remaining funds are
            available for housing stability services, including case management
            and other services intended to keep households stably housed.&nbsp;
            ERA1 funds generally expire on September 30, 2022.&nbsp; For ease of
            reference, the assistance listing number (CDFA number) assigned to
            the ERA program is 21.023.

          <p style="margin-bottom: 11px">
            ERA2 payments are made directly to states (including the District of

            American Samoa), and local governments with more than 200,000
            residents.&nbsp; ERA2 sets aside $2.5 billion for eligible grantees
            with a high need for ERA2 assistance, based on the number of very
            low-income renter households paying more than 50 percent of income
            on rent or living in substandard or overcrowded conditions, rental
            market costs, and change in employment since February 2020.
