  <h4>
    What the Department of the Treasury will do to ensure nondiscrimination
  </h4>
  <p>
    The Department of the Treasury will conduct investigations of civil rights complaints filed against recipients of financial assistance under any of its programs, and will conduct pre and post award compliance reviews.  If discrimination is found, the Department of the Treasury can defer action on an application for federal financial assistance, issue a cautionary letter, or as an ultimate consequence deny funding.  Independently of any possible actions to be taken by the Department of the Treasury, courts have interpreted that Title VI provides a private right of action.
