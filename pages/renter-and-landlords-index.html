              <p>
                If you require a reasonable accommodation or communication access services such as Communication Access Real-Time Translation (CART) or sign language interpreters in order to access Emergency Rental Assistance, please contact <a href="mailto:ReasonableAccommodationRequests@treasury.gov<">ReasonableAccommodationRequests@treasury.gov</a>. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Please submit sign language interpreter requests at least five days in advance of any interaction with an Emergency Rental Assistance Program.

              <h3>Civil Rights complaints</h3>
              <p>
                To file a program discrimination complaint about an Emergency Rental Assistance Program, send your complaint to:
              </p>

              <address> 
                <h5>Director, <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/about/offices/management/civil-rights-and-diversity/federally-assisted-programs-and-federally-conducted-programs">Office of Civil Rights and Diversity</a></h5>

              <h4>
                What the Department of the Treasury will do to ensure nondiscrimination
              </h4>
              <p>
                The Department of the Treasury will conduct investigations of civil rights complaints filed against recipients of financial assistance under any of its programs, and will conduct pre and post award compliance reviews. If discrimination is found, the Department of the Treasury can defer action on an application for federal financial assistance, issue a cautionary letter, or as an ultimate consequence deny funding. Independently of any possible actions to be taken by the Department of the Treasury, courts have interpreted that Title VI provides a private right of action.

              Funding to states, local, territorial, and Tribal governments
            </h3>
            <p>
              Even as the American economy continues its recovery from the devastating impact of the pandemic, millions of Americans face deep rental debt and fear evictions and the loss of basic housing security. COVID-19 has exacerbated an affordable housing crisis that predated the pandemic and that has deep disparities that threaten the strength of an economic recovery that must work for everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
              To meet this need, the Emergency Rental Assistance program makes funding available to government entities to assist households that are unable to pay rent or utilities.<br /><a
