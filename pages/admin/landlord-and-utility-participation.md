title: Getting landlords and utility services to participate
---

Treasury expects that in general, rental and utility assistance can be provided most effectively and efficiently when the landlord or utility provider participates in the program. 

As required by the Act, you must make reasonable efforts to get landlords and utility providers to accept payments from the ERA program. We consider outreach complete if you have 

*	Sent a request for participation in writing, by mail, to the landlord or utility provider, and the addressee does not respond to the request within 14 calendar days after mailing; 
*	You have tried at least three times by phone, text, or e-mail over a 10 calendar-day period to request the landlord or utility providerâ€™s participation; 

**Or**

*	A landlord confirms in writing that the landlord does not want to participate. 

Document your final outreach attempt or notice to the landlord. 

The cost of contacting landlords would be an eligible administrative cost.
