## Administrative Expenses

The Act provides that not more than 10 percent of the amount paid to a grantee under the ERA program may be used for administrative costs attributable to providing financial assistance and housing stability services to eligible households. 

The revised award term issued by Treasury permits recipients to use funds provided to cover both direct and indirect costs. In accordance with the statutory limitation on administrative costs, the total of all administrative costs incurred by the grantee and all subrecipients, whether direct or indirect costs, may not exceed 10 percent of the total amount of the award provided to the grantee from Treasury. (The grantee may permit a subrecipient to incur more than 10 percent of the amount of the subaward issued to that subrecipient as long as the total of all administrative costs incurred by the grantee and all subrecipients, whether as direct or indirect costs, does not exceed 10 percent of the total amount of the award provided to the grantee from Treasury.)

Further, the revised award term no longer requires grantees to deduct administrative costs charged to the award from the amount available for housing stability services. Rather, any direct and indirect administrative costs must be allocated by the grantee to either the provision of financial assistance or the provision of housing stability services. As required by the Act, not less than 90 percent of the funds received by a grantee shall be used to provide financial assistance to eligible households. Not more than 10 percent of funds received by a grantee may be used to provide eligible households with housing stability services (discussed in FAQ 23). To the extent administrative costs are not readily allocable to one or the other of these categories, the grantee may assume an allocation of the relevant costs of 90 percent to financial assistance and 10 percent to housing stability services.

Grantees may apply their negotiated indirect cost rate to the award but only to the extent that the total of the amount charged pursuant to that rate and the amount of direct costs charged to the award does not exceed 10 percent of the amount of the award.

## Document your policies for how you prioritize applications

Document your policies and procedures for determining a household’s eligibility to include determining the priority of households who meet the general eligibility criteria set out in statute. Include procedures for how you will record and report your determinations. 
Include clear descriptions of when you will accept written attestations from applicants without additional documentation for any aspect of eligibility or the amount of assistance. 
You must also have controls in place to ensure compliance with your policies and procedures and prevent fraud. Describe how you will validate your determinations and include policies and procedures for preventing fraud and abuse.

## Using subrecipients, intergovernmental agreements, or vendor contracts to administer your ERA program

**Subawards**. You can use ERA funds to make subawards to other entities administer the program for you. You may want to partner with non-profit organizations, and other local governments to administer the program with you. 

Any entity you make subawards or payments to from the ERA program are subject to the monitoring and management requirements in 2 CFR 200.331-200.333.

**Contracts**. You may also enter into contracts using ERA payments for goods or services to implement ERA programs. If you do, you must comply with the procurement standards in 2 CFR 200.317-200.327. 

Treasury encourages grantees to achieve administrative efficiency and fiduciary responsibility by collaborating with other grantees in joint administrative solutions to deploying ERA resources.

## Your program will not be required to remit interest earned to Treasury

ERA payments made by Treasury to states, territories, and the District of Columbia are not subject to the requirement of the Cash Management Improvement Act and Treasury’s implementing regulations at 31 CFR part 205 to remit interest to Treasury. ERA payments made by Treasury to local governments, Tribes, and TDHEs are not subject to the requirement of 2 CFR 200.305(b)(8)-(9) to maintain balances in an interest-bearing account and remit payments to Treasury.
