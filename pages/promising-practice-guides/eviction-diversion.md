## Partnerships with Broader Eviction Diversion Programs

Many grantees have found that partnerships with the local court systems and legal services organizations are critical tools in preventing housing insecurity and helping landlords recover from built-up rental arrears. While the court systems and eviction processes vary across different states and localities, many grantees have found that proactively engaging with local courts, legal aid organizations, and other stakeholders involved in the eviction process can help to reach renters most at risk of housing instability. Many programs have developed systems where renters facing eviction in the court system have lower documentation requirements to prove eligibility for ERA funds.

Efforts by ERA grantees are sometimes complementary to the broader eviction diversion programs and play an important function in expediting ERA applications in cases where the landlord has already started the evictions process. Many of these eviction diversion efforts seek to avoid eviction at the earliest stage of the process and often incorporate support from legal service professionals and eviction mediators. Some ERA grantees have found that court data can also inform targeted outreach efforts to landlords and/or high-need geographic areas.

### Focus on mediation

<h4 id="MA">The State of Massachusetts</h4>

The State of Massachusetts has developed a two-tiered eviction process that has integrated the ERA program into eviction proceedings. In the first tier, landlords and tenants work with a mediator who can direct them to ERA resources to cover qualified rental arrears. This state-funded program also engages with legal aid services, as well as housing reinstatement services for those cases where tenants ultimately experience eviction.

### Focus on data sharing with local courts

    <h4 id="Shelby">The city of Memphis and Shelby County, TN</h4>
    <p>
      The city of Memphis and Shelby County’s joint program has developed a data sharing relationship with the local court system. This partnership allows for ERA program administrators to have real-time information about neighborhoods with increased numbers of evictions. This information supports more targeted tenant and landlord outreach activities. Using this data, the ERA program administrators have been able build relationships with larger apartment complexes, leading to direct engagement with tenants on the premises. Memphis and Shelby County have also contracted with a local nonprofit organization with experience providing legal services to tenants facing evictions, helping them to reach settlements and avoid evictions. Further grantee efforts to expand access to legal services include engaging with volunteers from the local law school in order to extend tenants’ access to legal services. The Memphis and Shelby County ERA program expedites ERA applications that come through these channels, which has allowed many households to use ERA funds to stay in stable housing when faced with imminent eviction.

<h4 id="PHL">The city of Philadelphia, PA</h4>

The city of Philadelphia’s ERA program is also integrated directly into the city’s eviction court system. The court requires defendants to apply for the city’s ERA program before allowing the eviction to proceed. Further, all landlords who enroll in the city’s ERA program are automatically enrolled in the eviction diversion system, alerting them to the resources offered by the city to help avoid tenant evictions, such as nonprofit mediation services.

### Focus on a multi-faceted approach

<h4 id="SDF">The city of Louisville, KY</h4>

Louisville, KY is utilizing a multi-pronged approach to eviction diversion that includes legal representation for tenants, community based outreach, and collaboration with local courts. The city has allocated $400,000 of their ERA funding to enact a right to counsel program for tenants with children who are facing eviction. Their Office of Resilience and Community Services has partnered with the Office of Women, Office of Housing, Neighborhood Place, and the Coalition for the Homeless to target and reach out to Louisville residents at risk of eviction. The collaboration with the Office of Women was born out of the recognition that female led households, especially those headed by African-Americans, are disproportionately targeted for eviction. Outreach includes knocking on doors, sending texts, and making phone calls to encourage these tenants not to miss their court dates. Staff also attend eviction court on a daily basis and can coordinate with the judges to stay eviction for tenants who could benefit from emergency rental assistance. To aid tenants who "self-evict", by moving when they receive an eviction notice, the city has put in place a rapid-rehousing program that provides a rental deposit and the first month’s rent to help people relocate.

## Eviction diversion maturity levels

The following maturity model can help grantees shape a strategy and have actionable steps to address eviction diversion. A maturity model is a tool that helps organize strategy, practices, and process into a framework that can act as a blueprint for building up stronger capabilities. This model is intended to aid you in determining which stage of development your program is at and how to iterate and improve aspects of your program to become more robust and comprehensive so that you can be effective in stabilizing households.

The practices in <strong>bold</strong> are known to have been adopted by one or more grantees.  

**Disclaimer**: The practices referenced in this model may contemplate the leveraging of ERA funding with other federal, state, and local resources. The model's reference to an example practice should not be construed as confirming such practice's eligibility for any particular type or category of federal funding. Grantees should consult the governing federal program authorities for additional guidance before expending funds for such purposes to confirm eligibility.

## Guidance

### What steps can ERA grantees take to prevent evictions for nonpayment of rent?

Treasury strongly encourages grantees to develop partnerships with courts in their jurisdiction that adjudicate evictions for nonpayment of rent to help prevent evictions and develop eviction diversion programs. For example, grantees should consider: (1) providing information to judges, magistrates, court clerks, and other relevant court officials about the availability of assistance under ERA programs and housing stability services; (2) working with eviction courts to provide information about assistance under ERA programs to tenants and landlords as early in the adjudication process as possible; and (3) engaging providers of legal services and other housing stability services to assist households against which an eviction action for nonpayment of rent has been filed.

### Fact Sheet June 24, 2021

From the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Treasury_Fact_Sheet_6-24-21.pdf">June 24, 2021 Fact sheet</a>

Summarized below, Treasury’s updated <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/faqs/">FAQs</a> offer additional clarity for grantees and work in concert with guidance and actions being taken by other federal agencies.

#### Strongly encourage partnerships with courts to actively prevent evictions and develop eviction diversion programs.

Emergency Rental Assistance funds can be used to help families at-risk of eviction remain in their homes, including working with courts to connect such families and their landlords with mediation and emergency rental assistance resources, engaging providers of housing stability services for active support, and working directly with court administrators to facilitate eviction diversion programs. New Treasury FAQs also make clear that funds from the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds can be used to support these activities and a wide range of other eviction prevention and housing stability services.


#### Help families experiencing homelessness gain access to assistance.

For vulnerable families that do not have a current rental obligation—which is a requirement for emergency rental assistance eligibility—Treasury is creating a commitment letter process to help those families gain access to assistance. ERA can help families who have lost, or are at imminent risk of losing, their housing, by paying for relocation assistance, prospective rent, security deposits, and temporary hotel accommodations.

#### Drive towards equal access by removing language and cultural barriers in securing emergency rental assistance. 

Treasury is strongly encouraging grantees to provide culturally and linguistically-relevant housing stability services and to conduct outreach in multiple languages so that eligible families do not face unnecessary barriers to access. Grantees who cannot provide such services themselves should be engaging partners with the capacity to do so to ensure equal access to emergency rental assistance for all eligible households.

#### Provide a streamlined payment option for utility providers and large landlords to make accessing emergency rental assistance on behalf of multiple tenants easier and more attractive.

Treasury is clarifying how grantees may achieve economies of scale by obtaining information in bulk from utility providers and landlords with multiple units to help speed the determination of household eligibility and to bundle, in a single payment, approved amounts for the benefit of multiple eligible tenants.

#### Encourage grantee coordination to reduce the burdens, and delays in providing assistance created by differences in locally-imposed requirements among programs operating in the same regions.

Grantees providing services to overlapping or neighboring areas should collaborate to develop consistent or complementary policies to avoid unnecessary confusion or burdens for families or landlords seeking aid.

#### Lifting up grantees implementing effective practices to ensure that assistance quickly reaches the renters who need it most.

Treasury is highlighting "<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/promising-practice-guides/">promising practices</a>" inspired by successes achieved in the field, including partnerships with local court systems and legal services to prevent evictions and housing instability; options for reducing documentation barriers that might keep eligible families from accessing ERA; and application procedures that speed eligibility determinations through increased reliance on automation and fact-specific proxies.


### Fact Sheet May 7, 2021

From the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/FACT_SHEET-Emergency-Rental-Assistance-Program_May2021.pdf">May 7, 2021 Fact sheet</a>

#### Protects Renters from Eviction While Payments Are Being Made on Their Behalf.

Starting with today’s guidance, programs must prohibit the eviction of renters for nonpayment in months for which they receive emergency rental assistance. While most landlords are working to secure relief and help renters stay in place, Treasury strongly encourages grantees to require that landlords not evict tenants for nonpayment of rent for 30 to 90 days longer than the period covered by the emergency rental assistance as a condition of receiving payment.
