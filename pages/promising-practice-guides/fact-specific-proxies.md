title: Using Fact-Specific Proxies to Simplify Documentation Requirements
---

Many grantees have also built significant efficiencies through fact-specific proxies.  Many are exploring additional strategies to expand the use of written attestation to document household income when coupled with other reasonable fact-specific proxy for household income, such as applicants’ participation in other government programs with similar income eligibility criteria or census-tract data on the average incomes in the household’s geographic area. 

### Example

#### The City of Philadelphia, PA

In the City of Philadelphia, PA, the Department of Planning and Development marshalled efforts to quickly build a website, custom application, and back-end database in English and Spanish. The system can cross-reference data with public housing authorities and local utility companies (which helps reduce some of the applicant’s documentation requirements for debts owed), validates income eligibility requirements, and guards against duplication of benefits. 

#### The States of Indiana and Massachusetts

The States of Indiana and Massachusetts also have found significant efficiencies by reducing documentation requirements for applicants who can have eligibility verified through other state-based health and human services programs. 

#### The State of Kentucky

The State of Kentucky has started to implement a zip-code based fact-specific proxy to reduce income documentation requirements in high need areas. The state-based grantee has worked with Louisville and Lexington to aligned program design and policies. These shared practices have also helped reduce the administrative burden of the urban county governments.
