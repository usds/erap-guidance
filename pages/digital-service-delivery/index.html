<h2>Considerations for good service delivery</h2>

<p>Grantees should  make decisions based of the intersection of these different factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Grantee Business Needs</strong>:  Resources, skills, and operations must have to run, to serve effectively, and manage their budgets.</li>
  <li><strong>Social and Political Landscape</strong>: The general situation or attitude held by the community or stakeholders that will determine the reaction to decisions or changes.</li> 
  <li><strong>Grantee and Partner Capacity</strong>: The bandwidth the grantee organization to meet future demand and how it might impact the organization and community.</li> 
  <li><strong>Community Needs (tenants and landlords)</strong>: Governments have to actively reach out to understand the needs of some of the public, including some of the most historically marginalized communities and those in crisis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Human-centered design</h2>
<p>
  Human-centered design is an approach that can help grantees better understand the needs of tenants and landlords, thus creating a more impactful ERA program. The approach provides methods that put the public at the center of decision-making, design, and implementation of services. It is a creative problem-solving process that includes community members and emphasizes a much deeper understanding of their needs in order to arrive at solutions that truly reflect the community’s needs and solves for root problems. 
</p>
<p>
  Human-centered design is grounded in values: accessibility, equity and usability. These are the values that should be driving and shaping grantee’s ERA program.
</p>

<h2>Values</h2>
<p>
  Values are the cornerstones for how to shape the ERA program. They reinforce what is important, create a unified purpose and guide the behaviors and approaches in how we deliver ERA programs.
</p>

<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p>
  Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 states that federal "...agencies must give disabled employees and members of the public access to information comparable to the access available to others." Therefore, we expect grantees to do the same for ERA and the program and application should be <a href="https://accessibility.digital.gov/">accessible to all</a>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create applications and services that make them accessible to all people, regardless of age, disability, or other factors.</li>
  <li>Design for the spectrum of disabilities, for they can be permanent (eg. chronic health condition), temporary (eg. broken arm) or situational (eg. having a loud home).</li>
  <li>The accessibility of an application pertains to the visual design/layout, language used, the user/product interaction, and more.</li> 
  <li>Local ERA Program targeted outreach is a key component of making ERA applications accessible.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Equity</h3>
<p>
  ERA applications and programs should be designed with an understanding of the realities of communities. We are missing an opportunity to really meet community needs when this does not happen, and the continued marginalization of these communities breaks trust when governments do not co-design with them.  This ultimately results in worse outcomes for already historically marginalized communities such as higher eviction rates. 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create an ongoing, inclusive engagement process with the community and stakeholders to be involved and align their feedback with tangible action and iteration on application design and process (eg. Reach out to get feedback directly from targeted community members, not advocates.)</li>
  <li>Consider who has the current ability/privilege to participate in your ERA program and create ways to increase access and barrier bust.</li>
  <li>Create culturally relevant solutions and service supports to the application process.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Usability</h3>
<p>
  ERA websites and applications should be easy to find and access. If an application is difficult to use, people will get discouraged to apply for assistance and are significantly more likely not to use it. Usability factors include: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>How easy it is to pick up and self navigate</li>
  <li>How quickly can they perform tasks</li>
  <li>How easily can they re-enter an application and pick-up a task again</li>
  <li>How many and what kinds of <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/slips/">errors</a> do users make due to the design</li>
  <li>How enjoyable it is to use the design</li>
</ul>
