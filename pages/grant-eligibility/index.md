An "eligible household" is defined as a renter household in which at least one or more individuals meets the following criteria:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
 <li>Qualifies for unemployment or has experienced a reduction in household income, incurred significant costs, or experienced a financial hardship due to COVID-19;</li>
	<li>Demonstrates a risk of experiencing homelessness or housing instability; and</li>
	<li>Has a household income at or below 80 percent of the area median.</li>
</ol>

Rental assistance provided to an eligible household should not be duplicative of any other federally funded rental assistance provided to such household.

Eligible households that include an individual who has been unemployed for the 90 days prior to application for assistance and households with income at or below 50 percent of the area median are to be prioritized for assistance.

Household income is determined as either the household’s total income for calendar year 2020 or the household’s monthly income at the time of application. For household incomes determined using the latter method, income eligibility must be redetermined every 3 months.

## Eligibility of Local Governments

A unit of local government eligible for receipt of direct payment includes a county, municipality, town, township, village, parish, borough, or other unit of general government below the State level with a population that exceeds 200,000.
