Some local governments (for example, a city) may be entirely within the boundaries of a larger local government (for example, a county or parish). The larger local government may include, for purposes of determining whether it meets the 200,000 threshold for eligibility, the population of the smaller, constituent local government. 

The population used to calculate the larger local government’s payment amount will depend on whether any smaller, constituent local government that is eligible to receive a payment provides a certification for payment:

* If the smaller, constituent local government does not provide a certification for payment, the entire population of the larger local government (including the population of the smaller local government) will be used for purposes of calculating its payment amount. 
* If the smaller, constituent local government provides a certification for payment, the population of the smaller local government will be subtracted from the population of the larger local government for purposes of calculating its payment amount. 

The following examples illustrate these points. 

* County A has a total population of 250,000, comprised of 75,000 in City B (the incorporated part of the county within the borders of County A) and 175,000 in the unincorporated part of the county.
	* County A is eligible to receive a payment, because its total population (including both the incorporated City A and the unincorporated part of the county) is greater than 200,000. 
	* County A’s payment amount will be calculated based on a population of 250,000.
	* City B is not eligible to receive a payment because its population is less than 200,000. 
* County C has a total population of 400,000, comprised of 300,000 in City D (the incorporated part of the county) and 100,000 in the unincorporated part of the county.
	* Both County C and City D are eligible to provide a certification, because their total respective populations exceed 200,000. 
	* If County C provides a certification but City D does not, County C’s payment amount will be based on a population of 400,000. 
	* If both County C and City D provide certifications, County C’s payment amount will be calculated based on a population of 100,000 (total population less the population of City D). City D’s payment amount will be calculated based on its population of 300,000.
