## Overview

### You can cover prospective rent payments for up to 3 months at a time

You can pay for prospective rent payments for up to 3 months at a time. Households can get assistance for additional months if your program has available funds, and the additional assistance for a household does not exceed a total of 12 months at the time the household applies for additional prospective help.

### You can pay for other housing-related expenses due directly or indirectly to the COVID-19 pandemic 

The Act requires that other expenses must be related to housing and be incurred due directly or indirectly due to COVID-19. 

Examples. Such expenses include:

*	Relocation expenses, which may include rental security deposits, and 
*	rental fees, which may include application or screening fees, if a household has been temporarily or permanently displaced due to the COVID-19 outbreak; 
*	reasonable accrued late fees (if not included in rental or utility arrears and if incurred due to COVID-19); 
*	and Internet service provided to the rental unit.

### Use up to 10% of ERA funds for housing stability services related to the COVID-19 pandemic 

Here the priority is to ensure that eligible households can maintain or get housing. Housing stability services might include 

*	Housing counseling 
*	Fair housing counseling 
*	Case management related to housing stability
*	Housing related services for survivors of domestic abuse or human trafficking 
*	Attorney’s fees related to eviction proceedings
*	Specialized services for people with disabilities or seniors that support their ability to access or maintain housing. 

You must maintain records on payments for housing stability services. Document what the services were and the amount of funds spent on them.

### Do not use ERA program funds to pay homeowners for mortgage, utility, or energy costs 

Under the Act, ERA assistance may be provided only to eligible households, which is defined to include only households that are obligated to pay rent on a residential unit.

## Rental and Utility Arrears

### You can pay for rental or utility arrears and/or prospective costs 

Treasury’s assumption is that most households will need help paying rental and/or utility arrears. But the statute does not prohibit payment of only prospective rent or utility costs. 

If an applicant has rental arrears, you cannot commit to paying prospective rent payments unless you also provide assistance to reduce the rental arrears. [501(c)(2)(B)(iii) of Division N of the Act]

### You can cover arrears back to March 13, 2020

You can pay for arrears that accrued before the law was enacted up to March 13, 2020 [the date of the emergency declaration pursuant to section 501(b) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5191(b)].

### You do not have to cover all arrears 

You can structure your program to cover less than the full amount of arrears. You can pay for **up to** 12 months’ worth of arrears. You can provide an additional 3 months of prospective rent or utility payments, if you determine that the additional assistance is necessary to ensure stable housing for the applicant household.

## Types of Housing Covered

### You can assist applicants living in federally subsidized housing 

You can assist an eligible household that occupies a federally subsidized residential or mixed-use property, provided that ERA funds are not applied to costs that have been or will be reimbursed under any other federal assistance.

If an eligible household receives a monthly federal subsidy (e.g., a Housing Choice Voucher, Public Housing, or Project-Based Rental Assistance) and the tenant rent is adjusted according to changes in income, you can assist the renter household under the ERA program for the tenant-owed portion of rent or utilities that is not subsidized.

When providing ERA assistance, you must review the household’s income and sources of assistance to confirm that the assistance does not duplicate any other assistance, including federal, state, or local assistance provided for the same costs.

### You can provide assistance to households that you are the landlord for

As long as your ERA program complies with the provisions of the Act, the award terms, and this guidance, you can assist households for which you are the landlord. **You must ensure that your ERA program does not give preference to households living in your properties.**

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/implementation-guidance/faqs#18" class="era-guidance__faq-reference"><span class="usa-tag">FAQ #18</span></a>

### You can provide assistance to households with rent-to-own agreements 

You can provide assistance to households that are renting their residence under a “rent-to- own” agreement. (This is an agreement where the renter has the option (or obligation) to purchase the property at the end of the lease term.)  The household is eligible if a member of his or her household:

*	Is not a signor or co-signor to the mortgage on the property;
*	Does not hold the deed or title to the property; and
*	Has not exercised the option to purchase.

### You can provide assistance for rent, rental arrears, and utility costs for a manufactured home and/or the parcel it occupies 

If a household resides in a manufactured home, you can use ERA funds to assist with rent of the manufactured home and/or the parcel of land the manufactured home occupies. These households can also receive assistance for utilities and other expenses related to housing. 

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/implementation-guidance/faqs#28" class="era-guidance__faq-reference"><span class="usa-tag">FAQ #28</span></a>

### You can cover the cost of a hotel of motel room under certain circumstances 

You can cover the cost of a hotel or motel room occupied by an eligible household as “other expenses related to housing incurred due, directly or indirectly, to the COVID-19 outbreak” if:

*	The household has been temporarily or permanently displaced from its primary residence or does not have a permanent residence elsewhere;
*	the total months of assistance provided to the household do not exceed 12 months (plus an additional three months if necessary to ensure housing stability for the household); and
*	documentation of the hotel or motel stay is provided and the other applicable requirements provided in the statute and this guidance are met.

The cost of the hotel or motel stay must not include incidental expenses.

Develop and document policies and procedures detailing under what circumstances your program will provide assistance to cover hotel or motel stays. 

As you do develop policies around paying for hotel or motel rooms, consider the cost effectiveness of offering assistance for this purpose compared to other uses. If a household is eligible for an existing program with narrower eligibility criteria that can provide similar assistance for hotel or motel stays, such as the HUD Emergency Solutions Grant program or FEMA Public Assistance, you should direct applicants to those programs before providing similar assistance under the ERA program.

## Utilities &amp; Internet

### You can pay for utilities and other costs 

Utilities and home energy costs are separately stated charges related to the occupancy of rental property. Utilities and home energy costs include separately stated electricity, gas, water and sewer, trash removal, and energy costs, such as fuel oil. You can make payments to private or public utilities.

Applicants can show support for their energy costs using a bill, invoice, or evidence of payment to the provider of the utility or home energy service.

Utilities and home energy costs that are covered by the landlord must be treated as rent.

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/implementation-guidance/faqs#7" class="era-guidance__faq-reference"><span class="usa-tag">FAQ #7</span></a>

### You can pay for Internet service

Internet service provided to a residence is related to housing and is in many cases a vital service that allows renters to engage in distance learning, telework, and telemedicine, and obtain government services. 

Create clear, documented policies about when your program will cover Internet and when it will not. For example, if covering Internet costs would reduce the amount of funds available for rental assistance, you may decide that your program prefer to prioritize housing costs such as rent and utilities over Internet. 

All payments for housing-related expenses must be supported by documentation such as a bill, invoice, or evidence of payment to the provider of the service. 

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/implementation-guidance/faqs#7" class="era-guidance__faq-reference"><span class="usa-tag">FAQ #7</span></a>

### You can assist with utilities without assisting with rent 

Your program is not required to provide assistance for rent to provide assistance for utility or energy costs. The limitations on prospective rent payments do not apply to assistance for utilities or home energy costs.
