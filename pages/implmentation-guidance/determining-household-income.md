title: Determining household income
---

Households must have had 80% or less of area median income to be eligible for assistance. 

You can determine income eligibility based on either: 

The household’s total income for calendar year 2020. 

**Or**

Sufficient conformation of the household’s monthly income at the time they apply. 

If you use a household’s monthly income to determine eligibility, review use the monthly income information to extrapolate over a 12-month period.

      If a household qualifies based on monthly income, you must redetermine household eligibility every three months for as long as the household is getting assistance in the ERA program.
