## Documenting rent and rental arrears

Get documentation that identifies the address and unit where the applicant resides, and the rental payment amount. Optimally, that documentation is a current lease that is signed by the applicant and the landlord or a sublessor. But if there is not a written lease, you may collect 

Evidence of paying utilities for the residential unit 

**Or** 

An attestation by the landlord who you can verify is the owner or management agent of the unit

**Or** 

Other reasonable documentation as you set out in your program policies. 

Examples of reasonable documentation of rent: 
*	Bank statements
*	Check stubs 
*	Anything that reasonably establishes a pattern of paying rent
*	Written attestation by a verified landlord

## Accepting a written attestation in place of documentation for income or rent obligations limits payments to 3 months

The most vulnerable households may have challenges providing supporting documentation. In these cases, you can accept a written attestation in place of documentation for income or rent obligations. 

If you do accept a written attestation rather than supporting documentation, you can provide assistance for only three months at a time. The idea is to give applicants the opportunity to gather additional documentation or negotiate with landlords to avoid eviction.

## Written attestation for rent and rental arrears 

If an applicant shows evidence of residence but cannot produce documentation of the amount of their rent and / or arrears, you can accept a written attestation from the applicant to support paying assistance up to the greater of Fair Market Rent or Small Area Fair Market Rent for the area where the applicant resides. Current determinations by HUD are available online at [https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr.html](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr.html). 

If you want to assist a household for longer than three months, you must obtain evidence of rent owed after three months. We expect that in most cases the household can provide documentation of the amount of the rental obligation in any applications for further assistance.

## Written attestation for income 

If you cannot verify all or part of a household’s income because of the impact of COVID-19, or if the income has been in cash, or if the household has no qualifying income, you can accept a written attestation from the applicant regarding household income. 

Example: If a business that someone in the household worked for closed because of COVID-19, it may be impossible to verify any income from that employer. 

In appropriate cases, you can rely on an attestation from a caseworker or other professional who knows the circumstances of the household to certify that the applicant’s household income qualifies for assistance. 

If you rely on a written attestation without supporting documentation of income, you must reassess income for that household every three months.

## While documentation supporting a claim for rental assistance is important, prioritize assisting extremely vulnerable populations

Grantees can be flexible about the format of documentation you require from tenant applicants. You can accept photocopies, scans, or digital photos of documents, e-mails, or attestations from employers, landlords, caseworkers, or others with knowledge of the household’s circumstances. 

You must require that all applications for assistance to include an attestation from the applicant that all information included is correct and complete.

You may decide to accept self-attestation in place of supporting documentation, as long as you document the criteria for allowing this and your staff who review cases and make determinations are trained to apply the criteria uniformly and consistently.

## Collect only enough documentation to have a reasonable basis for determining income 

Collect documentation of income that is adequate for determining income. For example: 

*	Pay stubs
*	W-2s
*	Wage statements 
*	Tax filings
*	Bank statements showing regular income
*	Attestation from an employer 

You may provide waivers or exceptions to requirements for documentation for people with disabilities that would make it difficult to get documentation, or when there are extenuating circumstances related to the pandemic, or the applicant lacks access to technology that they could use to get documentation.

## Documenting unemployment, loss of income, significant costs, or other COVID-related financial hardship

Grantees must document that one or more members of the applicant’s household either qualified for unemployment benefits 

**Or**

experienced a reduction in household income, incurred significant costs, or experienced other financial hardship due, directly or indirectly, to the COVID-19 outbreak. 

If the applicant claims to be qualified for unemployment benefits, you can collect  written attestation signed by the applicant 

**Or**

other relevant documentation regarding the household member’s qualification for unemployment benefits. 

If the tenant claims reduction in household income, significant costs, or other financial hardship due to COVID-19, you must get a written attestation signed by the tenant applicant that one or more members of the household meets this condition.
