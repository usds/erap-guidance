<h3>ERA1 ALLOCATIONS AND PAYMENTS</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 11px">
  ERA1 payments are made directly to states (including the District of
  Columbia), U.S. territories (Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin
  Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and
  American Samoa), local governments with more than 200,000 residents,
  the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, and Indian tribes (defined to
  include Alaska native corporations) or the tribally designated
  housing entity of an Indian tribe, as applicable (collectively the
  “eligible grantees”).<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  At least 90 percent of awarded funds must be used for direct
  financial assistance, including rent, rental arrears, utilities and
  home energy costs, utilities and home energy costs arrears, and
  other expenses related to housing.&nbsp; Remaining funds are
  available for housing stability services, including case management
  and other services intended to keep households stably housed.&nbsp;
  ERA1 funds generally expire on September 30, 2022.&nbsp; For ease of
  reference, the assistance listing number (CDFA number) assigned to
  the ERA program is 21.023.

  American Samoa), and local governments with more than 200,000
  residents.&nbsp; ERA2 sets aside $2.5 billion for eligible grantees
  with a high need for ERA2 assistance, based on the number of very
  low-income renter households paying more than 50 percent of income
  on rent or living in substandard or overcrowded conditions, rental
  market costs, and change in employment since February 2020.
