title: Guidelines for ERA program online applications
---

{% assign content = site.data.application-websites.content %}

<p class="usa-intro">
  It’s critically important that tenants and landlords are able to get through the ERA application process quickly and without undue burden. Online applications must be designed thoughtfully and intentionally to collect the information you need from the applicant. 
</p>
<p>
  To help accomplish these goals, Treasury has prepared these guidelines for creating and improving  ERA applications to be easy-to-use by ERA applicants. These best practices were created in conjunction with the U.S. Digital Service to help grantees of the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) programs with developing ERA applications <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>.  
</p>
<p>
  These application practices are for ERA grantees and their contractors building ERA applications.
