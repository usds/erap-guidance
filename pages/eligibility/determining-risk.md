title: Determining risk of experiencing homelessness or housing instability
---

The Act requires that one or more individuals in the household can demonstrate a risk of experiencing homelessness or housing instability. 

A tenant applicant can demonstrate that they meet this requirement by showing:

*	A past due utility bill 
*	Or rent notice or eviction notice
*	Or evidence of unsafe or unhealthy living conditions
*	Or any other evidence of risk, as determined by the grantee. 

Make sure your policies and procedures address how your staff will determine the presence of unsafe or unhealthy living conditions and what evidence of risk to accept to support their determination that a household satisfies this requirement.
