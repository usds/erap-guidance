## Households are eligible if they are obligated to pay rent on a residential dwelling and meet other criteria

A grantee may only use the funds provided in the ERA to provide financial assistance and housing stability services to eligible households. 

To be eligible, a household must be obligated to pay rent on a residential dwelling. In addition, the grantee must determine that all of the following must be true:

*	One or more individuals within the household has qualified for unemployment benefits or experienced a reduction in household income, incurred significant costs, or experienced other financial hardship due, directly or indirectly, to the COVID-19 outbreak;
*	One or more individuals within the household can demonstrate a risk of experiencing homelessness or housing instability; and
*	The household has a household income at or below 80% of area median income.

## There are no time-based nor current residence-based restrictions

Eligible households need not have been living at their current address when the COVID-19 public health emergency was declared. 

There is no requirement regarding the length of time an applicant has lived at their current address.

## Categorical eligibility 

If a householdâ€™s income has been verified to be at or below 80% of area median income through another local, state, or federal assistance program, you can rely on a determination letter from the government agency that verified the household income. That determination must have been made on or after January 1, 2020.

## Prioritize applicants with incomes less than 50% of area median income (AMI) 

Your ERA program should set up a preference system that prioritizes assistance to households with income of less than 50% of area median income and households with one or more members that have been unemployed for at least 90 days. 

Document your system for prioritizing applicants in your policies and procedures. Tell applicants verbally and in writing what the priorities are and how you will decide on their assistance.
